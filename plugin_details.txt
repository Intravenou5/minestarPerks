SETTING PERMISSIONS
	msperk.glow
	- Any player with this permission can use /glow and toggle a glow that surrounds them on and off

*Except for glow all other permissions are determined by the config.yml setup.

	msperk.<TYPE>.<GROUP/RANK>
	- Type would be like the kit type, food, tools, etc.
	- Group/rank should match your permission groups but can be anything you want to have separate groups.


EXAMPLE PERK CREATION
- Lets say we want to make an Ore-package perk. Different groups would get a little ore starting pack.
- In config.yml create a section called;   ore:   (just like default food section)
- Would look like this;
  ore:
    donator:
    - DIAMOND_ORE||Free Diamond||GOLD||1||700||A Donator Diamond!
    admin:
    - GOLD_ORE||Free Admin Gold||AQUA||32||700||I luv goooold!
    - DIAMOND_ORE||Free Diamonds||RED||10||700||An Admin Diamond!
- Player/group permissions would be; msperk.ore.donator & msperk.ore.admin
- If they have priv they'd use; /perk ore

In above example, player with msperk.ore.donator would get 1 free diamond and a cooldown of 700 minutes would begin.
A player with permission msperk.ore.admin would get 10 diamonds and 32 gold on 700min cooldown.
If they have both permissions they would get the perk listed first.


CONFIG.YML PERK (ITEM) FORMAT
	- each group can have any number of perks 
	- each perk a group can have is entered as follows;
  	mcItemName || displayName || nameColor || amountToGive || cooldownInMinutes || description

	(String)  mcItemName = must be the official Minecraft item name 
	(String)  displayName = this is the item(food) name players will see 
	(String)  nameColor = this is the color the item name will be 
	(Integer) amountToGive = how many of this item the player will receive 
	(Integer) cooldownInMinutes = how many minutes until player can receive the perk again 
	(String)  description = a small description of the item that the player will see under the items displayName 

	If a String must be empty, leave a space.
	If an Integer must be empty, use 0.
